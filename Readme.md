## Ideas

### GroupList

### ShareMessage

### MessageList
- Groups collapse to color balls on screen size reduction
- Tool tip when you hover over the author's icon

### MessageHeader

### CommentList

- Display number to the right of name, where number is the level of connection
   via LinkedIn
  * No way, LinkedIn is sooo boring. This is a product for everyone, including all the scrubs who don't have a linkedIn. That includes me.
- When scrolled up and new comment arrives, have a quarter opacity bottom strip
   displaying latest comment
  * I like the idea, How would it work though? What if 2 new comments arrive. What about 10?

### ShareComment
- emoticons: attracts girl attention
  * Definitely, it's a must have. We need to look for good emoticon libraries
- a dynamic row of templates: letter, document, etc
  * Maybe... Let's be more facebook then MySpace. Or Apple than Microsoft. A good message design should be able to cover talking about random shit with friends and writing a professional post. We shouldn't need people to pick their template.
- block color change on enter
  * Too complicated. Less options, better defaults. We should be making the decisions, not them. 
- Paint comment mode: turn the comment box into a canvas
  * Nice idea, maybe later..
- Figure out good verbs for: showing a picture, linking to something, starting or inviting someone to an event.
